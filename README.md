# kmeans-credit-card-clustering
we have dataset of +10k client with features like (age, marital_status, ...)
and we want to group customers into different "personas OR profilies" based on their
spending behavior and credit history.

- credit_limit: with credit card how much many able to spend.
- total_trans_amount: total money the customer spent.
- total_trans_count: how many transaction did

**Others Variable easy to understand**
